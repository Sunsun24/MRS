This project proposes an adaptive ArduPilot architecture based on version 4.5.0 of ArduPilot. It has the following features:

1. Seamlessly embed the model reference stabilization (MRS) Method into the open-source architecture of the Ardupilot autopilot suite.

2. It can be applied to all aerial/surface/marine vehicles of ArduPilot. This approach makes the vehicle more capable of handling uncertain conditions such as wind and varying payloads.
